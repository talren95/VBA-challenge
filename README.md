# VBA-challenge
In this module we learned an extensive amount of VBA and for this challenge I put those skills to the test.
The file named "Module_2_VBA_Challenge.bas" is my code/script for the excel file shared with the class for this challenge. I've also shared screenshots of my results and those can be found in the folder titled "Screenshots".

I used most of the fundementals we learned to complete this task. I also had some help from my tutor who was kind enough to lend their eyes and make sure I was on the right track. I also made use of ChatGPT for some assistance with coloring the cells, as well as helping me to remember the way we would assign certain values to certain cells, as it was difficult for me to undersand that concept at first however, I feel like I've gauged it well.

# What is the script concerning?
In my script, as asked, I wrote a code that would list out the overall yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume per ticker in a clear and concise format. To make this easier for the viewer I highlighted the cells with a green and a red color, respectively, based on whether they increased or decreased. I also calculated the greatest percentage increases and decreases, as well as the grand total for the volume.
I've tested this script on 2 different excel files, as well as different spreadsheets within those files so I'm quite confident.

# What do I make of the data presented to me?
At first I was overwhelmed with the amoun of data, but after cleaning it up and making more readable I was able to navigate through and see exactly which tickers did best and which fell short. This data does refresh so I'm unfortunately unable to give an in depth breakdown of the data itself.
